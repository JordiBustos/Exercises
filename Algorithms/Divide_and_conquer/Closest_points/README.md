# Closest-Points
Find the closest pair of point in a set of n points with n ≥ 0

In this problem, your goal is to find the closest pair of points among the given 𝑛
points. This is a basic primitive in computational geometry having applications in,
for example, graphics, computer vision, traffic-control systems.

Problem Description:
Task. Given 𝑛 points on a plane, find the smallest distance between a
pair of two (different) points.

Input Format. The first line contains the number 𝑛 of points. Each of the following 𝑛 lines defines a point
(𝑥_𝑖 , 𝑦_𝑖).
Constraints. 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10 5 ; −10 9 ≤ 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ≤ 10 9 are integers.
Output Format. Output the minimum distance.
